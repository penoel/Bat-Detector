# Bat-Detector
The bat detector takes ultrasonic sound from a source (bat, transmitter, etc) and adds it to a local oscillator.  The combined signal has a beat frequency (intermediate frequency) that is then filter to remove the higher frequencies.  It is currently used with a transmitter to show doppler shift.  The transmitter is mounted on a pendulum that swings towards and away from the detector.
